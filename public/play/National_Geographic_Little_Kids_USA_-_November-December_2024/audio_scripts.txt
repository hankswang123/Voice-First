Speaker 1: 00:00 
 大家好，欢迎来到我们的Podcast.

Speaker 1: 00:00 
 Hey there, explorers. Welcome to our deep dive. Today.

Speaker 2: 00:03 
 呃，是啊。

Speaker 2: 00:03 
 Uh, yeah.

Speaker 1: 00:04 
 我们今天要学一些很酷的动物。

Speaker 1: 00:04 
 We're going to learn all about some cool animals.

Speaker 2: 00:06 
 酷吗？

Speaker 2: 00:06 
 Cool?

Speaker 1: 00:07 
 来自一本杂志，像你在家里可能看的那种。

Speaker 1: 00:07 
 From a magazine. Kind of like the ones you might read at home.

Speaker 2: 00:09 
 哦，对，比如《国家地理 小小孩》杂志。

Speaker 2: 00:09 
 Oh, yeah, like National Geographic, Little Kids Magazine.

Speaker 1: 00:12 
 没错。

Speaker 1: 00:12 
 Exactly.

Speaker 2: 00:13 
 它里面有很多彩色图片和有趣的动物小知识。

Speaker 2: 00:13 
 It has lots of colorful pictures and fun facts about animals.

Speaker 1: 00:16 
 是的，而且这是十一月十二月这期。

Speaker 1: 00:16 
 Yeah. And this is the November December issue.

Speaker 2: 00:19 
 对的。

Speaker 2: 00:19 
 That's right.

Speaker 1: 00:20 
 那我们开始吧。第一个是斑马。看这张图片。

Speaker 1: 00:20 
 So let's get started. First up, we have zebras. Look at this picture.

Speaker 2: 00:26 
 哇。

Speaker 2: 00:26 
 Oh, wow.

Speaker 1: 00:26 
 它们全身都是黑白条纹。

Speaker 1: 00:26 
 They have black and white stripes all over their body.

Speaker 2: 00:29 
 是啊，太酷了。

Speaker 2: 00:29 
 Yeah. They're so cool.

Speaker 1: 00:31 
 你知道吗？那些条纹不只是好看，其实还能帮斑马保持健康。

Speaker 1: 00:31 
 Did you know those. Those stripes aren't just for looking cool. They actually help zebras stay healthy.

Speaker 2: 00:38 
 哦？怎么做到的？

Speaker 2: 00:38 
 Oh. How do they do that?

Speaker 1: 00:39 
 你知道苍蝇吧，那些嗡嗡飞的小虫，它们会咬斑马让它们生病。

Speaker 1: 00:39 
 Well, you know flies, Those little buzzing bugs. They can bite zebras and make them sick.

Speaker 2: 00:43 
 哦，不好。

Speaker 2: 00:43 
 Oh, no.

Speaker 1: 00:44 
 但是这些条纹会让苍蝇迷惑。

Speaker 1: 00:44 
 But the stripes, they confuse the flies.

Speaker 2: 00:47 
 真的？

Speaker 2: 00:47 
 Really?

Speaker 1: 00:47 
 对，这让它们很难落到斑马身上。

Speaker 1: 00:47 
 Yeah. Makes it hard for them to land on the zebra.

Speaker 2: 00:49 
 哇。

Speaker 2: 00:49 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 00:50 
 所以苍蝇就飞走去找别的动物。

Speaker 1: 00:50 
 So the flies fly away to find another animal.

Speaker 2: 00:53 
 真是个巧妙的小技巧。

Speaker 2: 00:53 
 That's a neat trick.

Speaker 1: 00:54 
 我也觉得，对吧？这样斑马就保持健康。

Speaker 1: 00:54 
 I know, right? So the zebras stay healthy.

Speaker 2: 00:56 
 聪明的条纹。

Speaker 2: 00:56 
 Smart stripes.

Speaker 1: 00:58 
 好，现在我们去高山那边看看。

Speaker 1: 00:58 
 Okay. Now let's travel to the high mountains.

Speaker 2: 01:00 
 噢——

Speaker 2: 01:00 
 Ooh.

Speaker 1: 01:01 
 那里有一种特别的山羊，叫螺角山羊（Markhor）。

Speaker 1: 01:01 
 Where we can find a very special goat called a markhor.

Speaker 2: 01:05 
 螺角山羊？那是什么？

Speaker 2: 01:05 
 A markhor? What's that?

Speaker 1: 01:06 
 它特别的地方是它有很长很长的角。

Speaker 1: 01:06 
 Well, what makes the markhor special is that it has really long horns.

Speaker 2: 01:11 
 长角。

Speaker 2: 01:11 
 Long horns.

Speaker 1: 01:12 
 而且你猜怎么着？它的角像巨大开瓶器一样螺旋扭转。

Speaker 1: 01:12 
 And guess what? The horns twist like a giant corkscrew.

Speaker 2: 01:15 
 哇，像开瓶器？

Speaker 2: 01:15 
 Whoa. A corkscrew?

Speaker 1: 01:17 
 是的，它们用角帮自己爬陡峭的岩石。

Speaker 1: 01:17 
 Yep. They use their horns to help them climb steep rocks.

Speaker 2: 01:19 
 哦。你能想象带着扭扭的角爬山吗？

Speaker 2: 01:19 
 Oh. Can you imagine climbing a mountain with twisty horns?

Speaker 1: 01:23 
 螺角山羊是超棒的攀岩高手。

Speaker 1: 01:23 
 Markhors are amazing climbers.

Speaker 2: 01:26 
 是啊。

Speaker 2: 01:26 
 They are.

Speaker 1: 01:26 
 你看，它们还有有趣的小胡子。

Speaker 1: 01:26 
 And look, they have these funny beards too.

Speaker 2: 01:28 
 哦，对。

Speaker 2: 01:28 
 Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1: 01:29 
 像一只爷爷山羊。

Speaker 1: 01:29 
 It's like a grandpa goat.

Speaker 2: 01:30 
 哈哈，一只带螺旋角的爷爷山羊。

Speaker 2: 01:30 
 Haha. A grandpa goat with corkscrew horns.

Speaker 1: 01:33 
 好，我们现在飞去南极洲。

Speaker 1: 01:33 
 Okay, let's fly over to Antarctica now.

Speaker 2: 01:35 
 噢——

Speaker 2: 01:35 
 Ooh.

Speaker 1: 01:36 
 那里超级寒冷又结冰，我们能找到一种爱雪的鸟。

Speaker 1: 01:36 
 Where it's super cold and icy. There we can find a bird that loves the snow.

Speaker 2: 01:41 
 一种喜欢雪的鸟？

Speaker 2: 01:41 
 A bird that loves snow?

Speaker 1: 01:42 
 它叫雪海燕。

Speaker 1: 01:42 
 It's called a snow petrel.

Speaker 2: 01:43 
 雪海燕？我从没听说过。

Speaker 2: 01:43 
 A snow petrel? Never heard of that one.

Speaker 1: 01:46 
 它们很擅长抓鱼。

Speaker 1: 01:46 
 They are very good at catching fish.

Speaker 2: 01:48 
 哦。

Speaker 2: 01:48 
 Oh.

Speaker 1: 01:48 
 它们用嘴——有点像它们的抓鱼“手”——从海里叼起鱼。

Speaker 1: 01:48 
 They use their beaks, which are kind of like their mouths, to grab fish from the ocean.

Speaker 2: 01:53 
 好的。

Speaker 2: 01:53 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 01:53 
 有时它们飞在水面上找鱼，有时站在冰上等待。

Speaker 1: 01:53 
 Sometimes they fly above water to look for fish. And sometimes they stand on the ice and wait.

Speaker 2: 01:58 
 真有耐心。

Speaker 2: 01:58 
 So patient.

Speaker 1: 01:59 
 它们甚至把巢建在高高的冰崖上。

Speaker 1: 01:59 
 And they even build their nests high up on icy cliffs.

Speaker 2: 02:02 
 哇。你能想象住在那么冷的地方吗？

Speaker 2: 02:02 
 Wow. Can you imagine living in such a chilly place?

Speaker 1: 02:05 
 冷死啦。很庆幸我们只是去看看。

Speaker 1: 02:05 
 Brr. I'm glad we're just visiting.

Speaker 2: 02:07 
 我也是。

Speaker 2: 02:07 
 Me too.

Speaker 1: 02:08 
 说到冷地方，你有没有试过在很深的雪里走路？

Speaker 1: 02:08 
 Speaking of cold places, have you ever tried to walk in really deep snow?

Speaker 2: 02:13 
 有，挺难的。

Speaker 2: 02:13 
 Yeah, it's hard.

Speaker 1: 02:14 
 对，很难。但有一种动物叫雪鞋兔。

Speaker 1: 02:14 
 It's hard. But there's an animal called a snowshoe hare.

Speaker 2: 02:18 
 雪鞋兔有特别的脚。

Speaker 2: 02:18 
 A snowshoe hare that has special feet.

Speaker 1: 02:21 
 它的脚让它可以轻松走在雪上。

Speaker 1: 02:21 
 That make it easy to walk on snow.

Speaker 2: 02:22 
 哦，特别的脚。

Speaker 2: 02:22 
 Oh, special feet.

Speaker 1: 02:24 
 它的脚又大又有毛，保持温暖。

Speaker 1: 02:24 
 Their feet are big and covered in fur to keep them warm.

Speaker 2: 02:27 
 好的。

Speaker 2: 02:27 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 02:28 
 而且还有叫“蹼”的东西。

Speaker 1: 02:28 
 And they have something called webbing.

Speaker 2: 02:30 
 蹼。

Speaker 2: 02:30 
 Webbing.

Speaker 1: 02:31 
 就是脚趾间有皮肤连在一起，像鸭子的脚。

Speaker 1: 02:31 
 Which means their toes are connected by skin, like a duck's foot.

Speaker 2: 02:35 
 哦，像鸭子。

Speaker 2: 02:35 
 Oh, like a duck.

Speaker 1: 02:36 
 这些蹼帮助它们走在雪面上不下沉。

Speaker 1: 02:36 
 And the webbing helps them walk on top of the snow without sinking.

Speaker 2: 02:40 
 哇。

Speaker 2: 02:40 
 Wow.

Speaker 1: 02:41 
 就像穿着雪鞋。快，想象一下在雪上蹦来蹦去不下陷。

Speaker 1: 02:41 
 It's like wearing snowshoes. So quick, imagine hopping through the snow without sinking.

Speaker 2: 02:44 
 那会很有趣。

Speaker 2: 02:44 
 That would be so fun.

Speaker 1: 02:46 
 现在我们来看一种超级大的动物。

Speaker 1: 02:46 
 Now let's meet an animal that's super big.

Speaker 2: 02:48 
 好。

Speaker 2: 02:48 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 02:49 
 它能在陆地和水里生活。

Speaker 1: 02:49 
 And can live both on land and in water.

Speaker 2: 02:51 
 两个都——

Speaker 2: 02:51 
 Bo.

Speaker 1: 02:52 
 它叫海象。

Speaker 1: 02:52 
 It's called a walrus.

Speaker 2: 02:53 
 海象。它们有长牙，对吗？

Speaker 2: 02:53 
 A walrus. Those have tusks, right?

Speaker 1: 02:55 
 对。看那些大长牙。

Speaker 1: 02:55 
 Yes. Look at those big tusks.

Speaker 2: 02:56 
 哇，看起来像巨大的牙齿。

Speaker 2: 02:56 
 Wow. They look like giant teeth.

Speaker 1: 02:58 
 海象有厚厚的皮肤，让它们在冷水里保暖。

Speaker 1: 02:58 
 Walruses have thick skin to help them stay warm in cold water.

Speaker 2: 03:02 
 好的。

Speaker 2: 03:02 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 03:03 
 它们还有鳍状肢，像胳膊和腿，帮它们游泳。酷吧？那长牙有什么用？

Speaker 1: 03:03 
 And they have flippers, which are like arms and legs that help them swim. Cool. So what are those tusks for?

Speaker 2: 03:09 
 它们会用长牙做很多事。

Speaker 2: 03:09 
 Well, they use them for lots of things.

Speaker 1: 03:11 
 比如？

Speaker 1: 03:11 
 Like what?

Speaker 2: 03:12 
 它们用长牙把身体从水里撑上冰面。

Speaker 2: 03:12 
 They use them to pull themselves out of the water and onto the ice.

Speaker 1: 03:15 
 好的。

Speaker 1: 03:15 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 03:16 
 还用来保护自己，和在沙里挖食物。

Speaker 2: 03:16 
 And they also use them to protect themselves from danger and to dig for food in the sand.

Speaker 1: 03:21 
 哦，比如蛤蜊。

Speaker 1: 03:21 
 Oh. Like clams.

Speaker 2: 03:23 
 没错。海象喜欢吃蛤蜊。

Speaker 2: 03:23 
 Exactly. Walruses love to eat clams.

Speaker 1: 03:28 
 酷。

Speaker 1: 03:28 
 Cool.

Speaker 2: 03:28 
 而且你猜。它们还用胡须来感觉食物，像多了一些手指。

Speaker 2: 03:28 
 And get this. They even use their whiskers to feel around for food. It's like having extra fingers.

Speaker 1: 03:34 
 太神奇了。

Speaker 1: 03:34 
 That's amazing.

Speaker 2: 03:35 
 是啊。

Speaker 2: 03:35 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 03:36 
 所以它们用胡须在沙下找蛤蜊。

Speaker 1: 03:36 
 So they use their whiskers to find clams under the sand.

Speaker 2: 03:38 
 哇，它们真的太酷了。

Speaker 2: 03:38 
 No. They are so cool.

Speaker 1: 03:40 
 好，准备好去外太空旅行了吗？

Speaker 1: 03:40 
 Okay. Are you ready for a trip to outer space?

Speaker 2: 03:42 
 外太空？

Speaker 2: 03:42 
 Outer space?

Speaker 1: 03:43 
 我们去金星吧。

Speaker 1: 03:43 
 Let's zoom over to Venus.

Speaker 2: 03:44 
 去金星？

Speaker 2: 03:44 
 But Venus?

Speaker 1: 03:45 
 一颗比披萨烤炉还热的行星。

Speaker 1: 03:45 
 A planet that's even hotter than a pizza oven.

Speaker 2: 03:47 
 比披萨炉还热？

Speaker 2: 03:47 
 Hotter than a pizza oven?

Speaker 1: 03:49 
 金星是天空中最亮的行星。

Speaker 1: 03:49 
 Venus is the brightest planet in our sky.

Speaker 2: 03:52 
 是的。

Speaker 2: 03:52 
 It is.

Speaker 1: 03:52 
 它被云层覆盖，但这些云和地球的不一样。

Speaker 1: 03:52 
 And it's covered in clouds. But these clouds are different from the clouds we see on Earth.

Speaker 2: 03:58 
 哪里不一样？

Speaker 2: 03:58 
 How are they different?

Speaker 1: 03:59 
 它们很厚，把太阳的热困在里面，让金星超级热。

Speaker 1: 03:59 
 They're thick and trap heat from the sun, which makes Venus super hot.

Speaker 2: 04:03 
 哇，想象整颗星球都那么热。

Speaker 2: 04:03 
 Wow. Imagine a whole planet that's super hot.

Speaker 1: 04:06 
 我可不想去那儿。

Speaker 1: 04:06 
 I wouldn't want to visit there.

Speaker 2: 04:07 
 我也不想。行星和地球差别真大，太神奇了。

Speaker 2: 04:07 
 Me neither. It's amazing how different planets can be from Earth.

Speaker 1: 04:11 
 我也是这么觉得。

Speaker 1: 04:11 
 I know, right?

Speaker 2: 04:12 
 欢迎回来。准备好继续看更多神奇的动物了吗？

Speaker 2: 04:12 
 Welcome back. Are you ready for more amazing animals?

Speaker 1: 04:16 
 当然。接下来是什么酷家伙？

Speaker 1: 04:16 
 You bet. What cool creature do we have next?

Speaker 2: 04:19 
 你听说过山魈吗？

Speaker 2: 04:19 
 Have you ever heard of a mandrill?

Speaker 1: 04:23 
 山魈？我不觉得听过。

Speaker 1: 04:23 
 A mandrill? I don't think so.

Speaker 2: 04:24 
 它们很酷，因为它们是最大的猴类。

Speaker 2: 04:24 
 Well, they're really cool because they're the largest kind of monkey.

Speaker 1: 04:27 
 最大的猴子，哇。它长什么样？

Speaker 1: 04:27 
 The biggest monkey. Wow. What does it look like?

Speaker 2: 04:30 
 山魈以非常多彩出名。

Speaker 2: 04:30 
 Mandrills are famous for being very colorful.

Speaker 1: 04:34 
 五颜六色？

Speaker 1: 04:34 
 Colorful?

Speaker 2: 04:34 
 它们的脸是红色和蓝色，屁股上也有彩色条纹。

Speaker 2: 04:34 
 Their faces are red and blue, and they have colorful stripes on their bottoms, too.

Speaker 1: 04:38 
 哇，它们一定——

Speaker 1: 04:38 
 Wow. They must.

Speaker 2: 04:40 
 是啊。

Speaker 2: 04:40 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 04:41 
 它们住在哪里？

Speaker 1: 04:41 
 Where do these mandrills live?

Speaker 2: 04:42 
 山魈生活在非洲的森林里。

Speaker 2: 04:42 
 Mandrills live in the forests of Africa.

Speaker 1: 04:45 
 森林里？

Speaker 1: 04:45 
 The forests?

Speaker 2: 04:46 
 你能看到它们在树上荡来荡去，也在林地上找食物。

Speaker 2: 04:46 
 You can find them swinging from trees and looking for food. Down on the forest floor.

Speaker 1: 04:51 
 它们喜欢吃什么？

Speaker 1: 04:51 
 What kind of food do mandrills like to eat?

Speaker 2: 04:53 
 它们既吃植物也吃动物。

Speaker 2: 04:53 
 Well, mandrills eat both plants and animals.

Speaker 1: 04:55 
 植物和动物。

Speaker 1: 04:55 
 Plants and animals.

Speaker 2: 04:56 
 一种动物如果两者都吃，我们叫它“杂食动物”。

Speaker 2: 04:56 
 When an animal eats both plants and animals, we call that an omnivore.

Speaker 1: 05:00 
 杂食动物。

Speaker 1: 05:00 
 Omnivore.

Speaker 2: 05:00 
 所以山魈是杂食动物。

Speaker 2: 05:00 
 So a mandrill is an omnivore.

Speaker 1: 05:02 
 好的，懂了。

Speaker 1: 05:02 
 Okay, got it.

Speaker 2: 05:03 
 它们啃好吃的水果、种子和小虫。

Speaker 2: 05:03 
 They munch on yummy fruits and seeds and bugs.

Speaker 1: 05:05 
 哦，好吃。

Speaker 1: 05:05 
 Oh, yummy.

Speaker 2: 05:06 
 有时还会吃小型爬行动物，比如蜥蜴。

Speaker 2: 05:06 
 And sometimes they even eat small reptiles like lizards.

Speaker 1: 05:09 
 蜥蜴。哇，听起来它们胃口真不错。我们继续看一种你可能见过的动物——绿头鸭。

Speaker 1: 05:09 
 Lizards. Wow. It sounds like mandrills have quite the appetite. Let's move on to an animal you might have seen before. The mallard duck.

Speaker 2: 05:19 
 哦对，绿头鸭。

Speaker 2: 05:19 
 Oh yeah, mallards.

Speaker 1: 05:20 
 绿头鸭是一种你在世界各地都能找到的鸭子。

Speaker 1: 05:20 
 Mallards are a type of duck that you can find all over the world.

Speaker 2: 05:23 
 没错。它们住在水边，比如池塘、湖和河流。

Speaker 2: 05:23 
 That's right. They live near water like ponds, lakes and rivers.

Speaker 1: 05:26 
 是啊，我以前在公园见过绿头鸭。

Speaker 1: 05:26 
 Yeah, I've seen mallards at the park before.

Speaker 2: 05:29 
 它们喜欢游泳。

Speaker 2: 05:29 
 They love to swim.

Speaker 1: 05:30 
 真的？它们有闪亮的绿色头和亮黄色的嘴。

Speaker 1: 05:30 
 They do? They have that shiny green head and a bright yellow beak.

Speaker 2: 05:33 
 对的。

Speaker 2: 05:33 
 Exactly.

Speaker 1: 05:34 
 它们在水里找什么吃的？

Speaker 1: 05:34 
 What do they find to eat in the water?

Speaker 2: 05:35 
 绿头鸭是杂食动物，就像山魈一样。

Speaker 2: 05:35 
 Well, mallard ducks are omnivores, just like mandrills.

Speaker 1: 05:38 
 哇，又一个杂食动物。

Speaker 1: 05:38 
 Oh wow. Another omnivore.

Speaker 2: 05:40 
 它们吃水里的植物和种子。

Speaker 2: 05:40 
 They eat plants and seeds in the water.

Speaker 1: 05:42 
 好的。

Speaker 1: 05:42 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 05:43 
 还会吞掉小昆虫。

Speaker 2: 05:43 
 And they also gobble up small insects.

Speaker 1: 05:45 
 昆虫？

Speaker 1: 05:45 
 Insects?

Speaker 2: 05:45 
 甚至还有住在水里的小蜗牛。

Speaker 2: 05:45 
 And even tiny snails that live in the water.

Speaker 1: 05:48 
 蜗牛。呃。

Speaker 1: 05:48 
 Snails. Yuck.

Speaker 2: 05:49 
 真厉害，动物无论住哪里都能找到食物。

Speaker 2: 05:49 
 It's amazing how animals are so good at finding food no matter where they live.

Speaker 1: 05:53 
 是啊，对吧？不管是森林还是湖泊。

Speaker 1: 05:53 
 I know, right? Whether it's a forest or a lake.

Speaker 2: 05:56 
 对。

Speaker 2: 05:56 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 05:57 
 总有好吃的。说到会生存的动物，我们看看紫海胆。

Speaker 1: 05:57 
 There's always something tasty to eat. Speaking of animals that know how to survive, let's take a look at the purple sea urchin.

Speaker 2: 06:04 
 紫色海胆？

Speaker 2: 06:04 
 A purple sea urchin?

Speaker 1: 06:06 
 紫色海胆。那是什么东西？我从没听过。

Speaker 1: 06:06 
 Purple sea urchin. What in the world is that? I've never heard of it.

Speaker 2: 06:10 
 它是住在海里的很有趣的小生物。

Speaker 2: 06:10 
 It's a really interesting creature that lives in the ocean.

Speaker 1: 06:13 
 海里？它圆圆的像个球。

Speaker 1: 06:13 
 The ocean? It's shaped like a ball.

Speaker 2: 06:16 
 一个球？

Speaker 2: 06:16 
 A ball?

Speaker 1: 06:16 
 身上覆盖着尖刺。

Speaker 1: 06:16 
 And is covered in sharp spines.

Speaker 2: 06:18 
 刺？

Speaker 2: 06:18 
 Spines?

Speaker 1: 06:19 
 保护它不被其他想吃它的动物攻击。

Speaker 1: 06:19 
 To protect it from other animals that might want to eat it.

Speaker 2: 06:21 
 所以有点像水下的仙人掌？

Speaker 2: 06:21 
 So it's kind of like an underwater cactus?

Speaker 1: 06:23 
 嗯哼。

Speaker 1: 06:23 
 Uh huh.

Speaker 2: 06:24 
 它是什么颜色的？

Speaker 2: 06:24 
 And what color is it?

Speaker 1: 06:25 
 你觉得是什么颜色？

Speaker 1: 06:25 
 What color do you think it is?

Speaker 2: 06:27 
 是紫色吗？

Speaker 2: 06:27 
 Is it purple?

Speaker 1: 06:28 
 没错，它是紫色的。

Speaker 1: 06:28 
 You got it. It's purple.

Speaker 2: 06:29 
 太酷了。它们身上那么多尖刺，怎么移动？看起来很难走动。

Speaker 2: 06:29 
 So cool. How do they move around with all those pointy spines? It seems like that would make it hard to get around.

Speaker 1: 06:34 
 紫海胆有很小的小脚，叫“管足”。

Speaker 1: 06:34 
 Well, purple sea urchins have these tiny little feet called tube feet.

Speaker 2: 06:39 
 管足？

Speaker 2: 06:39 
 Tube feet?

Speaker 1: 06:40 
 它们用管足慢慢在海底爬行。

Speaker 1: 06:40 
 That they use to slowly crawl along the ocean floor.

Speaker 2: 06:43 
 哇，像一个慢动作水下行走的仙人掌。太神奇了。好，我们还有什么动物？

Speaker 2: 06:43 
 Wow. So it's like a slow motion walking cactus underwater. That's amazing. Okay, what other amazing animal do we have to meet?

Speaker 1: 06:51 
 准备好认识一种很特别的野猫——狞猫。

Speaker 1: 06:51 
 Get ready to learn about a very special wild cat called a caracal.

Speaker 2: 06:56 
 狞猫？

Speaker 2: 06:56 
 A caracal?

Speaker 1: 06:57 
 听说过吗？

Speaker 1: 06:57 
 Ever heard of it?

Speaker 2: 06:57 
 我从没听过狞猫。它特别在哪里？

Speaker 2: 06:57 
 I've never heard of a caracal before. What makes it so special?

Speaker 1: 07:00 
 狞猫以很长的耳朵出名。

Speaker 1: 07:00 
 Caracals are known for their really long ears.

Speaker 2: 07:03 
 长耳朵？

Speaker 2: 07:03 
 Long ears?

Speaker 1: 07:03 
 它们的耳朵末端有一撮毛。

Speaker 1: 07:03 
 Their ears have tufts of fur at the tips.

Speaker 2: 07:06 
 好的。

Speaker 2: 07:06 
 Okay.

Speaker 1: 07:06 
 让它们看起来更长。那撮毛我们叫“耳饰毛”。

Speaker 1: 07:06 
 Making them look extra long. We call those tufts of fur tufted ears.

Speaker 2: 07:11 
 耳饰毛。

Speaker 2: 07:11 
 Tufted ears.

Speaker 1: 07:12 
 这些耳朵帮助它们听见最细微的声音。哇，我猜这在狩猎时很有用。

Speaker 1: 07:12 
 Those ears help them hear even the tiniest sounds. Wow. I bet that comes in handy when they're hunting.

Speaker 2: 07:17 
 你说得完全对。狞猫能听见草丛里老鼠和鸟的小动作。

Speaker 2: 07:17 
 You're exactly right. Caracals can hear small animals like mice and birds moving around in the grass.

Speaker 1: 07:23 
 哇，像耳朵是一个雷达帮它们找食物。

Speaker 1: 07:23 
 Wow. So it's like their ears are a radar to help them find food.

Speaker 2: 07:26 
 没错没错。你猜？狞猫幼崽长得特别快。

Speaker 2: 07:26 
 Exactly. Exactly. And guess what? Caracal kittens grow up really quickly.

Speaker 1: 07:30 
 哦，多快？

Speaker 1: 07:30 
 Oh, how quickly?

Speaker 2: 07:31 
 当它们十个月大的时候。

Speaker 2: 07:31 
 By the time they are 10 months old.

Speaker 1: 07:32 
 十个月大？

Speaker 1: 07:32 
 10 months old?

Speaker 2: 07:33 
 它们就能自己捕猎。

Speaker 2: 07:33 
 They can hunt on their own.

Speaker 1: 07:34 
 哇，十个月，相当于动物世界的少年了。

Speaker 1: 07:34 
 Wow. 10 months old. That's like being a teenager in the animal world.

Speaker 2: 07:38 
 是啊。

Speaker 2: 07:38 
 Yeah.

Speaker 1: 07:39 
 好，我准备好看下一个动物了。我们还有什么？

Speaker 1: 07:39 
 Okay, I'm ready for our next animal. What do we have?

Speaker 2: 07:42 
 来了解一种看起来像多种动物混合的生物。

Speaker 2: 07:42 
 Let's learn about an animal that looks like a mix of different animals.

Speaker 1: 07:46 
 好。

Speaker 1: 07:46 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 07:46 
 你听说过貉（又叫狸狗 / 貉犬）吗？

Speaker 2: 07:46 
 Have you ever heard of a raccoon dog?

Speaker 1: 07:48 
 貉？它是浣熊还是狗？我好困惑。

Speaker 1: 07:48 
 A raccoon dog? Is it a raccoon or a dog? I'm so confused.

Speaker 2: 07:53 
 两者都有一点。貉是和狐狸、狼同一家族的野生动物。

Speaker 2: 07:53 
 It's a little bit of both. Both raccoon dogs are wild animals that are part of the same family as foxes and wolves.

Speaker 1: 08:00 
 狐狸和狼。

Speaker 1: 08:00 
 Foxes and wolves.

Speaker 2: 08:01 
 但它们的脸和浣熊很像。

Speaker 2: 08:01 
 But their faces look a lot like raccoons.

Speaker 1: 08:03 
 所以像不同动物组合。

Speaker 1: 08:03 
 So they are like a combination of different animals.

Speaker 2: 08:06 
 对。

Speaker 2: 08:06 
 Exactly.

Speaker 1: 08:06 
 好酷。

Speaker 1: 08:06 
 How cool.

Speaker 2: 08:07 
 它们有像狐狸一样的蓬松尾巴。

Speaker 2: 08:07 
 They have a bushy tail like a fox.

Speaker 1: 08:09 
 好的。

Speaker 1: 08:09 
 Okay.

Speaker 2: 08:10 
 像狗一样的尖鼻子，还有眼睛周围像浣熊一样的黑色“面具”。

Speaker 2: 08:10 
 A pointy nose like a dog. And a black mask around their eyes just like a raccoon.

Speaker 1: 08:16 
 就像大自然把各种好的部分拼在他们身上。

Speaker 1: 08:16 
 It's like nature decided to take the best parts of different animals and put them all together.

Speaker 2: 08:20 
 我同意，对吧？

Speaker 2: 08:20 
 I know, right?

Speaker 1: 08:21 
 好神奇的组合。我想知道“浣熊狗”这个名字怎么来的。

Speaker 1: 08:21 
 What a cool combination it is. I wonder how they came up with the name raccoon dog.

Speaker 2: 08:25 
 我也想。

Speaker 2: 08:25 
 Me too.

Speaker 1: 08:26 
 它们住在哪里？

Speaker 1: 08:26 
 Where do raccoon dogs live?

Speaker 2: 08:27 
 它们生活在亚洲和欧洲部分地区的森林和草地。

Speaker 2: 08:27 
 Raccoon dogs live in forests and grasslands in parts of Asia and Europe.

Speaker 1: 08:33 
 森林和草地。

Speaker 1: 08:33 
 Forests and grasslands.

Speaker 2: 08:35 
 还记得我们学过山魈是杂食动物吗？

Speaker 2: 08:35 
 And remember how we learned that mandrills are omnivores?

Speaker 1: 08:37 
 记得。

Speaker 1: 08:37 
 Yes.

Speaker 2: 08:38 
 因为它们吃植物也吃动物。貉也是杂食动物，所以什么都吃。

Speaker 2: 08:38 
 Because they eat both plants and animals. Well, raccoon dogs are omnivores too, so they eat everything.

Speaker 1: 08:44 
 这很合理。因为如果你住在很多不同地方，就要会到处找食物。

Speaker 1: 08:44 
 That makes sense. Because if you live in a lot of different places, you need to be able to find food everywhere.

Speaker 2: 08:49 
 对，它们很适应环境。

Speaker 2: 08:49 
 Yeah. They're very adaptable.

Speaker 1: 08:51 
 我喜欢学习这些神奇动物。我们接下来有什么？

Speaker 1: 08:51 
 I love learning about all these amazing animals. What do we have next?

Speaker 2: 08:55 
 我们去看看一种很鲜艳的青蛙——草莓毒蛙。

Speaker 2: 08:55 
 Let's hop over to meet a very colorful frog, the strawberry poison frog.

Speaker 1: 09:00 
 草莓毒蛙？为什么叫“毒”蛙？

Speaker 1: 09:00 
 Strawberry poison frog? Why is it called a poison frog?

Speaker 2: 09:04 
 因为它皮肤里有毒。

Speaker 2: 09:04 
 Because it has poison in its skin.

Speaker 1: 09:06 
 有毒？它危险吗？

Speaker 1: 09:06 
 Poison? Is it dangerous?

Speaker 2: 09:08 
 有一点，但别担心。不碰它就不会伤到你。

Speaker 2: 09:08 
 It is a little bit dangerous, but don't worry. It won't hurt you if you don't touch it.

Speaker 1: 09:12 
 好的，我会把手放好。但为什么叫“草莓”呢？

Speaker 1: 09:12 
 Okay, good. I'll be sure to keep my hands to myself. But why is it Called a strawberry.

Speaker 2: 09:16 
 因为它鲜红，就像草莓一样。

Speaker 2: 09:16 
 Poison frog because it is bright red, just like a strawberry.

Speaker 1: 09:20 
 哦。我猜鲜红颜色是告诉别的动物它有毒不要吃。

Speaker 1: 09:20 
 Oh. I bet that bright red color is a warning to other animals that it is dangerous to eat it.

Speaker 2: 09:27 
 是的。

Speaker 2: 09:27 
 That's right.

Speaker 1: 09:27 
 就像一个大招牌写着“别吃我”。

Speaker 1: 09:27 
 It's like a big sign that says, don't eat me.

Speaker 2: 09:29 
 你完全正确。毒蛙鲜艳的颜色就是大自然的警告：嘿，我有毒，别吃我。

Speaker 2: 09:29 
 You are exactly right. The bright colors on poison frogs are nature's way of warning other animals to stay away. It's their way of saying, hey, I'm poisonous. Don't eat me.

Speaker 1: 09:39 
 哇。想象一下你就是一个会走路的警示牌。太酷了。好，我们今天还学什么？

Speaker 1: 09:39 
 Wow. Imagine being a walking warning sign. That's so cool. Okay, what else do we have to learn about today?

Speaker 2: 09:46 
 哇，我们从那本《国家地理小小孩》杂志里学了好多神奇动物。我们看到斑马用条纹迷惑苍蝇；螺角山羊用长长的螺旋角爬山；雪海燕能在冰冷水里抓鱼。

Speaker 2: 09:46 
 Wow. We learned about so many incredible animals from that National Geographic little kids magazine. We saw zebras with stripes that confuse flies. Mark horse with their super long twisty horns for climbing mountains. And snow petrels who can hunt for fish in icy water.

Speaker 1: 10:04 
 还有雪鞋兔。哦，对，它们有特别的脚能走在雪上不下沉，像自带雪鞋。

Speaker 1: 10:04 
 And don't forget about the snowshoe hare. Oh, yeah, they have those special feet that help them walk on top of the snow without sinking. It's like they have built in snowshoes.

Speaker 2: 10:13 
 对，而且我们不能忘了海象。

Speaker 2: 10:13 
 That's right. And we can't forget about walruses.

Speaker 1: 10:15 
 哦，它们的大长牙和胡须——

Speaker 1: 10:15 
 Oh. With their big tusks and whiskers that.

Speaker 2: 10:17 
 像多出来的手指。

Speaker 2: 10:17 
 Are like extra fingers.

Speaker 1: 10:18 
 没错。

Speaker 1: 10:18 
 Exactly.

Speaker 2: 10:19 
 用胡须在沙下找蛤蜊。所有这些动物的特殊本领真令人惊叹。

Speaker 2: 10:19 
 Use those whiskers to find clams under the sand. It's incredible how all these animals have special features.

Speaker 1: 10:24 
 我同意，对吧？

Speaker 1: 10:24 
 I know, right?

Speaker 2: 10:25 
 它们用这些本领生存。从炎热的非洲草原到冰冷的南极，动物们适应各种环境。

Speaker 2: 10:25 
 That help them survive. From the hot African savanna to the icy cold, Antarctic animals have adapted to all sorts of environments.

Speaker 1: 10:33 
 我们还快速去了趟外太空，了解超热的金星。厚厚的云层锁住太阳热量，让那里太热无法造访。

Speaker 1: 10:33 
 And we even went on a quick trip to outer space to learn about the super hot planet Venus. Its thick clouds trap the heat from the sun, making it way too hot for us to visit.

Speaker 2: 10:43 
 想想宇宙里有那么多不同行星和动物，真让人惊奇。还有好多东西可以探索发现。

Speaker 2: 10:43 
 It's amazing to think about all the different planets and animals that exist in our universe. There's so much to explore and discover.

Speaker 1: 10:50 
 那你最喜欢的动物是哪一个？

Speaker 1: 10:50 
 So what was your favorite animal that we learned about today?

Speaker 2: 10:53 
 嗯，好难选。

Speaker 2: 10:53 
 Hmm, that's a tough one.

Speaker 1: 10:55 
 我也是，对啊，太多酷的了。

Speaker 1: 10:55 
 I know, right? Yeah, there's so many cool ones.

Speaker 2: 10:58 
 我想我最喜欢雪鞋兔。

Speaker 2: 10:58 
 But I think my favorite is the snowshoe hare.

Speaker 1: 11:00 
 哦，雪鞋兔。

Speaker 1: 11:00 
 Oh, the snowshoe hare.

Speaker 2: 11:01 
 它们能在雪上跳来跳去不下沉，太棒了。

Speaker 2: 11:01 
 It's amazing how they can hop through the snow without sinking.

Speaker 1: 11:04 
 我知道。

Speaker 1: 11:04 
 I know.

Speaker 2: 11:05 
 那些大大的毛脚和脚趾间的蹼是很聪明的雪地适应。

Speaker 2: 11:05 
 Those big furry feet and the webbing between their toes are such a clever adaptation for living in a snowy place.

Speaker 1: 11:12 
 很棒的选择。我最喜欢螺角山羊。

Speaker 1: 11:12 
 That's a great choice. I think my favorite is the markhor.

Speaker 2: 11:14 
 螺角山羊。

Speaker 2: 11:14 
 The markhor.

Speaker 1: 11:15 
 我爱它们那扭扭的角。

Speaker 1: 11:15 
 I love those twisty horns.

Speaker 2: 11:17 
 是啊，真的很酷。

Speaker 2: 11:17 
 Yeah, they're pretty cool.

Speaker 1: 11:17 
 让它们看起来很独特。假如你能拥有一种动物超能力，你会选什么？

Speaker 1: 11:17 
 It makes them look so unique. I wonder if you could have any animal superpower. What would you choose?

Speaker 2: 11:23 
 哦，好问题。

Speaker 2: 11:23 
 Ooh, that's a good question.

Speaker 1: 11:25 
 你会想要像猎豹那样超高速，像变色龙那样伪装，还是像鸟一样会飞？

Speaker 1: 11:25 
 Would you want to have super speed like a cheetah, the ability to camouflage like a chameleon, or maybe even the power to fly like a bird.

Speaker 2: 11:35 
 太多选择了。

Speaker 2: 11:35 
 So many choices.

Speaker 1: 11:36 
 想一想也很有趣，对吧？拥有动物的特殊本领会是什么感觉。

Speaker 1: 11:36 
 It's fun to think about. It is what it would be like to have special abilities like animals.

Speaker 2: 11:41 
 好啦，今天的深度探险时间到这里。但记住，学习我们周围的世界是一场永不停息的冒险。

Speaker 2: 11:41 
 Well, that's all the time we have for today's deep dive. But remember, learning about the world around us is an adventure that never ends.

Speaker 1: 11:48 
 所以继续探索、继续提问。

Speaker 1: 11:48 
 So keep exploring and asking questions.

Speaker 2: 11:50 
 你永远不知道会发现多么惊奇的东西。

Speaker 2: 11:50 
 You never know what amazing things you might discover.
