Speaker 1: 00:00

欢迎(Welcome)大家来到我们的博客。今天我们来谈谈动物(animals)。

Speaker 1: 00:00

Welcome 🦉 to our deep dive 🧠🌊, everyone. Today we're going to be talking all about animals 🐾🦁.

Speaker 2: 00:03

是的，我非常喜欢(love)动物，我们会看一些非常酷的(cool)照片(pictures)吗？

Speaker 2: 00:03

Oh, I love animals. Are we going to see some cool pictures?

Speaker 1: 00:07

是的，我们会看到一些很酷的照片，也会学习一些新的单词。

Speaker 1: 00:07

Yes, we are going to see some cool pictures and learn some new words, too.

Speaker 2: 00:10

太棒了。我准备好了。

Speaker 2: 00:10

Awesome. I'm ready.

Speaker 1: 00:11

好的，首先我们看下这个猫头鹰。

Speaker 1: 00:11

Okay, so first, let's look at this owl.

Speaker 2: 00:14

噢，看它那双大眼睛。

Speaker 2: 00:14

Ooh. Look at its big eyes.

Speaker 1: 00:16

是的，猫头鹰有非常大的眼睛。它们需要这些眼睛在夜间看清东西。

Speaker 1: 00:16

Yeah, Owls have really big eyes. They need them to see at night.

Speaker 2: 00:20

它们为什么需要在夜间看清东西？是因为那时它们捕猎吗？

Speaker 2: 00:20

Why do they need to see at night? Is that when they hunt?

Speaker 1: 00:22

没错。猫头鹰白天睡觉，晚上醒来捕猎。

Speaker 1: 00:22

That's right. Owls sleep during the day and they wake up at night to hunt.

Speaker 2: 00:26

它们捕猎什么？

Speaker 2: 00:26

What do they hunt for?

Speaker 1: 00:26

它们捕猎像老鼠和田鼠这样的小动物。

Speaker 1: 00:26

They hunt for small animals like mice and voles.

Speaker 2: 00:29

这些猫头鹰真酷。那么它们住在哪里呢？

Speaker 2: 00:29

Those owls are so cool. So where do these owls live?

Speaker 1: 00:32

这些猫头鹰生活在英格兰。

Speaker 1: 00:32

These owls live in England.

Speaker 2: 00:34

英格兰？你能指给我地图上英格兰的位置吗？

Speaker 2: 00:34

England? Can you point to England on the map for me?

Speaker 1: 00:38

当然可以。英格兰就是这里的这个岛屿。你能说“England”吗？

Speaker 1: 00:38

Sure. England is this island right here. Can you say England?

Speaker 2: 00:41

England。

Speaker 2: 00:41

England.

Speaker 1: 00:42

说得太棒了。好，现在来看这个有趣的小动物。

Speaker 1: 00:42

Great job. Yeah. Okay, now, look at this funny little animal.

Speaker 2: 00:45

它是粉红色的，还带着一个壳。

Speaker 2: 00:45

It's pink and it has a shell.

Speaker 1: 00:48

没错。这是一只粉红仙女犰狳。

Speaker 1: 00:48

That's right. This is a Pink Fairy armadillo.

Speaker 2: 00:52

粉红仙女犰狳。哇，这个词好长啊。

Speaker 2: 00:52

Pink Fairy armadillo. Wow, that's a big word.

Speaker 1: 00:55

你能说“armadillo”吗？

Speaker 1: 00:55

Can you say armadillo?

Speaker 2: 00:56

Armadillo。这词真难念。

Speaker 2: 00:56

Armadillo. That's hard to say.

Speaker 1: 00:57

你做到了！这只犰狳非常小，只有你手掌那么长。

Speaker 1: 00:57

You got it. Now, this armadillo is very small. It's only about as long as your hand.

Speaker 2: 01:02

哇，真小啊。

Speaker 2: 01:02

Wow, that's tiny.

Speaker 1: 01:03

看到它背上的壳了吗？这个壳能帮助犰狳抵御危险。

Speaker 1: 01:03

And see that shell on its back? That shell helps protect the armadillo from danger.

Speaker 2: 01:09

哦，就像一个小盾牌。

Speaker 2: 01:09

Oh, like a little shield.

Speaker 1: 01:10

对，就像一个小盾牌。再看它那大爪子。

Speaker 1: 01:10

Yeah, just like a little shield. And look at those big claws.

Speaker 2: 01:13

我看到了。这些爪子是干什么用的？

Speaker 2: 01:13

I see them. What are those for?

Speaker 1: 01:15

它用这些爪子在沙子里挖隧道。

Speaker 1: 01:15

It uses those claws to dig tunnels in the sand.

Speaker 2: 01:18

隧道？它为什么要挖隧道？

Speaker 2: 01:18

Tunnels? Why does it need tunnels?

Speaker 1: 01:20

它住在这些隧道里。那是它睡觉和躲避捕食者的地方。

Speaker 1: 01:20

It lives in those tunnels. That's where it sleeps and hides from predators.

Speaker 2: 01:23

真聪明。

Speaker 2: 01:23

That's pretty smart.

Speaker 1: 01:24

是啊。

Speaker 1: 01:24

Yeah.

Speaker 2: 01:24

那么这只粉红仙女犰狳生活在哪里？

Speaker 2: 01:24

So where does this Pink Fairy armadillo live?

Speaker 1: 01:27

这只粉红仙女犰狳生活在阿根廷。

Speaker 1: 01:27

This Pink Fairy armadillo lives in Argentina.

Speaker 2: 01:29

阿根廷。你也能在地图上指给我看吗？

Speaker 2: 01:29

Argentina. Can you point to that on the map too, please?

Speaker 1: 01:32

当然。阿根廷在南美洲的最南端，看这里。

Speaker 1: 01:32

Of course. Argentina's way down here in South America. See?

Speaker 2: 01:36

哦，哇，好远啊。

Speaker 2: 01:36

Oh, wow. That's far away.

Speaker 1: 01:38

现在，我们来聊聊颜色。这只鹦鹉是什么颜色？

Speaker 1: 01:38

Now, let's talk about colors. What color is this parrot?

Speaker 2: 01:41

橙色。

Speaker 2: 01:41

Orange.

Speaker 1: 01:42

没错。你能想到其他橙色的东西吗？

Speaker 1: 01:42

Yep. Can you think of other things that are orange?

Speaker 2: 01:45

让我想想……南瓜是橙色的。

Speaker 2: 01:45

let me think. Pumpkins are orange.

Speaker 1: 01:49

好例子！

Speaker 1: 01:49

Good one.

Speaker 2: 01:50

哦，还有篮球也是橙色的。

Speaker 2: 01:50

Oh, and basketballs are orange.

Speaker 1: 01:51

没错。好，现在看看这个可爱的小宝宝。

Speaker 1: 01:51

That's right. Okay, now, look at this cute little baby.

Speaker 2: 01:54

哦，是只小猴子。

Speaker 2: 01:54

Oh, it's a baby monkey.

Speaker 1: 01:55

是的，这是只小红毛猩猩和它的妈妈。

Speaker 1: 01:55

Yes. It's a baby orangutan with its mommy.

Speaker 2: 01:58

Orangutan？什么是红毛猩猩？

Speaker 2: 01:58

Orangutan. What's an orangutan?

Speaker 1: 02:01

红毛猩猩是一种猿类。它们生活在雨林里，非常擅长爬树。

Speaker 1: 02:01

An orangutan is a type of ape. They live in the rainforest, and they are very good at climbing trees.

Speaker 2: 02:06

哇。为什么小猩猩要紧紧抱着妈妈？

Speaker 2: 02:06

Wow. Why is the baby holding onto its mommy?

Speaker 1: 02:09

小红毛猩猩会和妈妈待很长时间。妈妈会教它们在雨林中生存所需的一切技能。

Speaker 1: 02:09

Baby orangutans stay with their mommies for a long time. The mommies teach Them everything they need to know about surviving in the rainforest.

Speaker 2: 02:16

真温馨。它们学爬树和找食物吗？

Speaker 2: 02:16

That's nice. They learn how to climb trees and find food?

Speaker 1: 02:19

是的。它们甚至学会在树上搭窝。

Speaker 1: 02:19

Yep. They even learn how to build nests in the trees then.

Speaker 2: 02:23

搭窝？像鸟那样？

Speaker 2: 02:23

Nests? Like birds?

Speaker 1: 02:24

对，有点像鸟。它们用树叶和树枝在高高的树上做窝。

Speaker 1: 02:24

Yeah, kind of like birds. They make their nests out of leaves and branches high up in the trees.

Speaker 2: 02:29

酷。那么这些红毛猩猩生活在哪里？

Speaker 2: 02:29

Cool. So where do these orangutans live?

Speaker 1: 02:31

红毛猩猩生活在婆罗洲和苏门答腊岛上。

Speaker 1: 02:31

Orangutans live on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

Speaker 2: 02:35

婆罗洲和苏门答腊？我不知道它们在哪里。

Speaker 2: 02:35

Borneo and Sumatra. I don't know where those are.

Speaker 1: 02:38

我来在地图上指给你看。婆罗洲和苏门答腊是东南亚这里的岛屿。

Speaker 1: 02:38

Let me show you on the map. Borneo and Sumatra are these islands right here in Southeast Asia.

Speaker 2: 02:43

哦，我看到了。

Speaker 2: 02:43

Oh, I see.

Speaker 1: 02:44

好，你准备好玩游戏了吗？

Speaker 1: 02:44

Okay, are you ready for a game?

Speaker 2: 02:45

是的！我爱游戏。我们要玩什么游戏？

Speaker 2: 02:45

Yes. I love games. What game are we gonna play?

Speaker 1: 02:48

我们要玩一个配对游戏。看这只海象，它脸上有个有趣的东西，叫“胡子”（mustache）。

Speaker 1: 02:48

We are gonna play a matching game. Look at this walrus that has a funny thing on its face. It's called a mustache.

Speaker 2: 02:55

胡子（mustache）。我能试着拼写这个词吗？

Speaker 2: 02:55

A mustache. Can I try to spell that word?

Speaker 1: 02:57

当然可以。

Speaker 1: 02:57

Sure.

Speaker 2: 02:58

M-U-S-T-A-C-H-E。Mustache。

Speaker 2: 02:58

M U S T A C H e. Mustache.

Speaker 1: 03:02

你拼对了！现在看这只豪猪。它背上那些尖尖的东西是什么？

Speaker 1: 03:02

You got it. Now, look at this porcupine. What are those sharp, pointy things on its back?

Speaker 2: 03:07

那些看起来刺刺的。它们叫什么？

Speaker 2: 03:07

Those look pokey. What are they called?

Speaker 1: 03:09

那些叫“刺”（quills）。

Speaker 1: 03:09

Those are called quills.

Speaker 2: 03:10

Quills。怎么拼写？

Speaker 2: 03:10

Quills. How do you spell that?

Speaker 1: 03:12

Q-U-I-L-L-S。Quills。这些刺能帮助豪猪抵御捕食者。

Speaker 1: 03:12

Q, U, I, L, L, S. Quills. The quills help protect the porcupine from predators.

Speaker 2: 03:17

所以如果有其他动物攻击豪猪，就会被这些刺扎到？

Speaker 2: 03:17

So if another animal tries to attack the porcupine, it gets poked by the quills?

Speaker 1: 03:21

完全正确。现在看这只企鹅。它身上覆盖着什么？

Speaker 1: 03:21

Exactly. Now, look at this penguin. What is covering its body?

Speaker 2: 03:25

羽毛（feathers）。

Speaker 2: 03:25

Feathers.

Speaker 1: 03:26

没错。鸟类有羽毛。你能拼写“feathers”吗？

Speaker 1: 03:26

That's right. Birds have feathers. Can you spell feathers?

Speaker 2: 03:29

F-E-A-T-H-E-R-S。Feathers。

Speaker 2: 03:29

F, E A T H E R S. Feathers.

Speaker 1: 03:32

太棒了！现在看这个动物，它头上有大角。

Speaker 1: 03:32

Great job. Now, let's look at this animal. It has big horns on its head.

Speaker 2: 03:36

哇，那些角真大。这动物叫什么？

Speaker 2: 03:36

Wow. Those are big horns. What is that animal called?

Speaker 1: 03:39

那叫“羱羊”（ibex）。

Speaker 1: 03:39

That's called an ibex.

Speaker 2: 03:40

Ibex。I-B-E-X。

Speaker 2: 03:40

Ibex. I B, E X.

Speaker 1: 03:43

完全正确。最后但同样重要的是，看这只猴子。它有长长的尖牙，叫“獠牙”（tusks）。

Speaker 1: 03:43

Exactly. And last but not least, look at this monkey. It has long, pointy teeth called tusks.

Speaker 2: 03:49

Tusks。哇，它用獠牙做什么？

Speaker 2: 03:49

Tusks. Wow. What does it use its tusks for?

Speaker 1: 03:52

猴子用獠牙吃水果，也用来保护自己免受危险。

Speaker 1: 03:52

Monkeys use their tusks to eat fruit and to protect themselves from danger.

Speaker 2: 03:56

所以獠牙就像特殊的牙齿？

Speaker 2: 03:56

So tusks are like special teeth?

Speaker 1: 03:57

没错。好，现在我们来了解鬣狗。

Speaker 1: 03:57

That's right. Okay, now let's learn about hyenas.

Speaker 2: 03:59

鬣狗？是那种看起来像狗，但又不是狗的动物吗？

Speaker 2: 03:59

Hyenas? Are those the animals that kind of look like dogs, but they're not dogs?

Speaker 1: 04:03

没错。鬣狗不是狗，但和狗有亲缘关系。它们生活在叫“族群”（clans）的大家庭里。

Speaker 1: 04:03

That's right. Hyenas are not dogs, but they are related to dogs. And they live in big families called clans.

Speaker 2: 04:09

Clans？什么是族群？

Speaker 2: 04:09

Clans? What's a clan?

Speaker 1: 04:11

族群是一群生活在一起、互相帮助的动物。

Speaker 1: 04:11

A clan is a group of animals that live together and help each other.

Speaker 2: 04:14

哦，所以它们像一个团队？

Speaker 2: 04:14

Oh, so they're like a team?

Speaker 1: 04:15

完全正确。它们合作捕猎，保护领地。

Speaker 1: 04:15

Exactly. They work together to hunt and to protect their territory.

Speaker 2: 04:19

真酷。那么这些鬣狗生活在哪里？

Speaker 2: 04:19

That's cool. So where do these hyenas live?

Speaker 1: 04:22

鬣狗生活在非洲很多地方，包括一个叫博茨瓦纳的国家。

Speaker 1: 04:22

Hyenas live in many parts of Africa, including a country called Botswana.

Speaker 2: 04:26

博茨瓦纳。我们能在地图上看看吗？

Speaker 2: 04:26

Botswana. Can we see that on the map?

Speaker 1: 04:28

当然。博茨瓦纳就在非洲南部这里。

Speaker 1: 04:28

Sure. Botswana is right here in southern Africa.

Speaker 2: 04:30

哦，我看到了。博茨瓦纳还有其他动物吗？

Speaker 2: 04:30

Oh, I see it. Are there other animals that live in Botswana too?

Speaker 1: 04:34

是的，博茨瓦纳生活着很多其他动物，比如大耳狐。

Speaker 1: 04:34

Yes, lots of other animals live in Botswana. Like bat eared foxes.

Speaker 2: 04:38

大耳狐？那是什么？

Speaker 2: 04:38

Bat eared foxes? What are those?

Speaker 1: 04:40

大耳狐是耳朵特别大的小狐狸。

Speaker 1: 04:40

Bat eared foxes are small foxes with really big ears.

Speaker 2: 04:43

哦，我猜它们听力一定很好。

Speaker 2: 04:43

Oh, I bet they can hear really well then.

Speaker 1: 04:45

狮子也生活在博茨瓦纳。

Speaker 1: 04:45

And lions live in Botswana, too.

Speaker 2: 04:47

哇，狮子。那些又大又吓人。

Speaker 2: 04:47

Wow, lions. Those are big and scary.

Speaker 1: 04:50

还有斑马，身上有黑白条纹。

Speaker 1: 04:50

And zebras with their black and white stripes.

Speaker 2: 04:52

斑马很酷。我喜欢它们的条纹。

Speaker 2: 04:52

Zebras are cool. I like their stripes.

Speaker 1: 04:53

还有河马。

Speaker 1: 04:53

And hippos, too.

Speaker 2: 04:54

河马。那些是喜欢游泳的动物，对吧？

Speaker 2: 04:54

Hippos. Those are the ones that love to swim, right?

Speaker 1: 04:56

没错。河马花很多时间待在水里保持凉爽。

Speaker 1: 04:56

That's right. Hippos spend a lot of time in the water to stay cool.

Speaker 2: 05:00

这主意不错。

Speaker 2: 05:00

That's a good idea.

Speaker 1: 05:01

好，你准备好玩另一个游戏了吗？

Speaker 1: 05:01

Okay, are you ready for another game?

Speaker 2: 05:03

是的。这个游戏是关于什么的？

Speaker 2: 05:03

Yes. What's this game about?

Speaker 1: 05:05

这个游戏是关于陆地动物和水生动物的。你能告诉我哪些动物生活在陆地上，哪些生活在水里吗？

Speaker 1: 05:05

This game is about land animals and water animals. Can you tell me which animals live on land and which animals live in the water?

Speaker 2: 05:14

听起来很有趣。我觉得我能行。

Speaker 2: 05:14

Sounds fun. I think I can do that.

Speaker 1: 05:15

好的，第一个是大熊猫。陆地还是水中？

Speaker 1: 05:15

Okay, first up is the giant panda. Land or water?

Speaker 2: 05:19

大熊猫。我觉得熊猫生活在陆地上。

Speaker 2: 05:19

Giant panda. I think pandas live on land.

Speaker 1: 05:23

你答对了。大熊猫生活在中国的山区。它们吃竹子。

Speaker 1: 05:23

You're right. Giant pandas live in the mountains of China. And they eat bamboo.

Speaker 2: 05:27

太酷了。

Speaker 2: 05:27

Cool.

Speaker 1: 05:28

好，下一个是什么？

Speaker 1: 05:28

Okay, what's next?

Speaker 2: 05:29

下一个是虎鲸。陆地还是水中？

Speaker 2: 05:29

Next is an orca. Land or water orca?

Speaker 1: 05:32

哦，那是鲸鱼。虎鲸生活在水里。

Speaker 1: 05:32

Oh, that's a whale. Orcas live in the water.

Speaker 2: 05:35

没错。虎鲸有时被称为“杀人鲸”，但其实它们是海豚。

Speaker 2: 05:35

That's right. Orcas are sometimes called killer whales, but they are actually dolphins.

Speaker 1: 05:39

哇，我还不知道呢。

Speaker 1: 05:39

Whoa, I didn't know that.

Speaker 2: 05:40

小丑鱼呢？陆地还是水中？

Speaker 2: 05:40

How about a clownfish? Land or water clownfish?

Speaker 1: 05:45

我觉得它们也生活在水里。

Speaker 1: 05:45

I think those live in the water, too.

Speaker 2: 05:46

没错，你状态真好！小丑鱼生活在珊瑚礁中，颜色非常鲜艳。

Speaker 2: 05:46

Yep, you're on a roll. Clownfish live in coral reefs and they are very colorful.

Speaker 1: 05:51

好，轮到我提问了。长颈鹿呢？陆地还是水中？

Speaker 1: 05:51

Okay, my turn to ask. How about a giraffe? Land or water h?

Speaker 2: 05:56

长颈鹿。长颈鹿有长长的脖子，所以它们可以吃到树顶的叶子。这意味着它们生活在陆地上。答对了！那鸸鹋呢？

Speaker 2: 05:56

A giraffe. Giraffes have long necks so they can reach leaves high up in the trees. So that means they live on land. You got it. How about an emu?

Speaker 1: 06:04

鸸鹋是陆地还是水中动物？那是一种鸟，对吧？但我觉得鸸鹋不会飞。

Speaker 1: 06:04

Land or water emu? That's the kind of bird. Right, But I don't think emus can fly.

Speaker 2: 06:08

没错。鸸鹋不会飞，但跑得非常快。那么它们生活在哪里？

Speaker 2: 06:08

That's right. Emus can't fly. But they can run really fast. So where do they live?

Speaker 1: 06:11

在陆地上？

Speaker 1: 06:11

On land?

Speaker 2: 06:12

完全正确。现在又轮到我了。猴子呢？陆地还是水中？

Speaker 2: 06:12

Exactly. Now it's my turn again. How about a monkey? Land or water monkey?

Speaker 1: 06:16

猴子生活在树上，所以它们生活在陆地上。

Speaker 1: 06:16

Monkeys live in trees, so they live on land.

Speaker 2: 06:19

干得好。你越来越擅长这个游戏了。

Speaker 2: 06:19

Good job. You're getting so good at this.

Speaker 1: 06:21

我知道。很好玩。

Speaker 1: 06:21

I know. It's fun.

Speaker 2: 06:22

小龙虾呢？陆地还是水中？

Speaker 2: 06:22

Okay, how about a crayfish? Land or water crayfish? That sounds like a water animal to me.

Speaker 1: 06:30

没错。小龙虾生活在淡水河流和湖泊里。

Speaker 1: 06:30

That's right. Crayfish live in freshwater rivers and lakes.

Speaker 2: 06:33

最后一个：海星。陆地还是水中？

Speaker 2: 06:33

Okay, last one. Sea star. Land or water sea star.

Speaker 1: 06:39

你觉得海星生活在哪里？

Speaker 1: 06:39

Where do you think stars live?

Speaker 2: 06:40

在水里。

Speaker 2: 06:40

In the water.

Speaker 1: 06:41

答对了。海星生活在海洋里，有各种各样的颜色。

Speaker 1: 06:41

You got it. Sea stars live in the ocean and they come in lots of different colors.

Speaker 2: 06:44

我爱海星。它们太漂亮了。

Speaker 2: 06:44

I love sea stars. They're so pretty.

Speaker 1: 06:47

我也是。现在，我们来看这只鹿。它头上长着大大的鹿角。

Speaker 1: 06:47

Me too. Now, let's look at this deer. It has big antlers on its head.

Speaker 2: 06:51

哇，这些鹿角真大！这是什么鹿？

Speaker 2: 06:51

Wow. Those antlers are huge. What kind of deer is that?

Speaker 1: 06:54

这叫狍子。

Speaker 1: 06:54

This is called a roe deer.

Speaker 2: 06:55

狍子？能再慢点说一遍吗？

Speaker 2: 06:55

A roe deer. Can you say that again, please?

Speaker 1: 06:57

狍子。你能说“狍子”吗？

Speaker 1: 06:57

Roe deer. Can you say roe deer?

Speaker 2: 06:58

狍子。

Speaker 2: 06:58

Roe deer.

Speaker 1: 06:59

好样的！现在你知道雄性狍子为什么有鹿角了吗？

Speaker 1: 06:59

Good job. Now do you know why male roe deer have antlers?

Speaker 2: 07:04

是为了保护自己吗？

Speaker 2: 07:04

Is it to protect themselves?

Speaker 1: 07:06

是的，但它们也用鹿角和其他雄性狍子打架。

Speaker 1: 07:06

Yes, but they also use their antlers to fight other male roe deer.

Speaker 2: 07:10

为什么要打架？

Speaker 2: 07:10

Why do they fight?

Speaker 1: 07:11

为了展示谁更强壮，并赢得雌性狍子的注意。

Speaker 1: 07:11

They fight to show who is stronger and to win the attention of female roe deer.

Speaker 2: 07:15

所以这就像一场比赛？

Speaker 2: 07:15

So it's like a competition?

Speaker 1: 07:17

完全正确。你觉得狍子生活在哪里？

Speaker 1: 07:17

Exactly. Where do you think roe deer live?

Speaker 2: 07:19

它们也在非洲吗？

Speaker 2: 07:19

Are they in Africa too?

Speaker 1: 07:20

不。狍子不在非洲。它们生活在苏格兰、英格兰和威尔士。

Speaker 1: 07:20

Nope. Roe deer don't live in Africa. They live in Scotland, England and Wales.

Speaker 2: 07:24

苏格兰、英格兰和威尔士？它们都在同一个地方吗？

Speaker 2: 07:24

Scotland, England and Wales. Are those all in the same place?

Speaker 1: 07:27

是的。它们都是联合王国的一部分。

Speaker 1: 07:27

They are. They are all countries that are part of the United Kingdom.

Speaker 2: 07:30

能在地图上指给我看吗？

Speaker 2: 07:30

Can you show me on the map?

Speaker 1: 07:32

当然。苏格兰、英格兰和威尔士都在这个岛上。

Speaker 1: 07:32

Sure. Scotland, England, and Wales are all located on this island right here.

Speaker 2: 07:35

哦，哇！所以狍子和猫头鹰住得挺近的。

Speaker 2: 07:35

Oh, wow. So the roe deer live close to the owls.

Speaker 1: 07:38

没错。好了，准备好穿越时空去见恐龙了吗？

Speaker 1: 07:38

That's right. Okay, are you ready to go back in time to meet a dinosaur?

Speaker 2: 07:42

恐龙？太棒了！我超爱恐龙。

Speaker 2: 07:42

Dinosaurs? Yes. I love dinosaurs.

Speaker 1: 07:45

这只恐龙叫冠龙。

Speaker 1: 07:45

This dinosaur is called Corythosaurus.

Speaker 2: 07:47

冠龙？这名字真有趣。能再慢点说一遍吗？

Speaker 2: 07:47

Corythosaurus. What a funny name. Can you say that again slowly, please?

Speaker 1: 07:52

冠龙。

Speaker 1: 07:52

Corythosaurus.

Speaker 2: 07:53

冠龙。哇，真难念。它长什么样？

Speaker 2: 07:53

Corythosaurus. Wow. That's hard to say. What did it look like?

Speaker 1: 07:56

冠龙是一种大型植食恐龙，脖子很长，头上有一个大冠。

Speaker 1: 07:56

Corythosaurus was a big plant eating dinosaur with a long neck and a big crest on its head.

Speaker 2: 08:02

冠？什么是冠？

Speaker 2: 08:02

A crest? What's a crest?

Speaker 1: 08:04

冠是头骨上突出的骨板。看，这张图里能看得很清楚。

Speaker 1: 08:04

A crest is a bony plate that sticks up from the top of the head. Look. You can see in this picture.

Speaker 2: 08:10

哇，看起来像头盔。

Speaker 2: 08:10

Whoa. It looks like a helmet.

Speaker 1: 08:12

科学家认为冠龙可能用它的冠发出响亮的声音。

Speaker 1: 08:12

Scientists think Corythosaurus might have used its crest to make loud sounds.

Speaker 2: 08:16

是为了和其他冠龙交流吗？

Speaker 2: 08:16

Like to talk to other Corythosaurus?

Speaker 1: 08:18

也许。或者是为了吸引配偶。

Speaker 1: 08:18

Maybe. Or maybe it used its crest to attract mates.

Speaker 2: 08:21

这恐龙真酷。我还想看更多恐龙。

Speaker 2: 08:21

That's a cool dinosaur. I want to see more dinosaurs.

Speaker 1: 08:23

下次再看更多恐龙吧。现在我们玩今天最后一个游戏。

Speaker 1: 08:23

We'll see more dinosaurs another time. Now let's play one last game for today.

Speaker 2: 08:27

好，我准备好啦。

Speaker 2: 08:27

Okay, I'm ready to play.

Speaker 1: 08:29

看这些图片。你能找出名字以字母“T”结尾的图片吗？

Speaker 1: 08:29

Look at these pictures. Can you find the pictures whose names end with the letter T?

Speaker 2: 08:33

让我看看。“Bat”以T结尾。对！

Speaker 2: 08:33

Let me see. Bat ends with a T. Yes.

Speaker 1: 08:38

干得好。

Speaker 1: 08:38

Good job.

Speaker 2: 08:39

还有“tent”也以T结尾。没错！还有“peanut”也以T结尾。一共三个。

Speaker 2: 08:39

And tent ends with a T. You got it. And peanut ends with a T. That's three.

Speaker 1: 08:44

你找到了所有以字母T结尾的图片？你真是个单词侦探！太棒了！现在准备好认识更多神奇动物吧——这些是我们的“王牌动物”。

Speaker 1: 08:44

You found all the pictures that end with the letter T? You are a word detective. Yay. Now get ready to meet some more amazing animals. These are our wild cards.

Speaker 2: 08:53

王牌动物？这是什么意思？

Speaker 2: 08:53

Wild cards? What does that mean?

Speaker 1: 08:55

王牌动物是指特别独特、拥有非凡特征和适应能力的动物。

Speaker 1: 08:55

Wild cards are animals that are extra special and have unique features and adaptations.

Speaker 2: 08:59

哦，酷！像超能力一样？

Speaker 2: 08:59

Oh, cool. Like superpowers?

Speaker 1: 09:01

有点像超能力。首先是北极狼。

Speaker 1: 09:01

Kind of like superpowers. First up is the arctic wolf.

Speaker 2: 09:04

北极狼？“北极”是什么意思？

Speaker 2: 09:04

Arctic wolf? What's arctic?

Speaker 1: 09:06

“北极”意思是极寒和冰雪覆盖的地方。北极狼生活在非常寒冷的地方。

Speaker 1: 09:06

Arctic means very cold and icy. The Arctic wolf lives in a very cold place.

Speaker 2: 09:11

那它一定有厚厚的皮毛保暖。

Speaker 2: 09:11

So it must have a thick coat to stay warm.

Speaker 1: 09:13

没错。北极狼有厚厚的白色皮毛，帮助它们融入雪地，并在严寒中保持温暖。

Speaker 1: 09:13

That's right. Arctic wolves have thick white fur that helps them blend in with the snow and stay warm in freezing temperatures.

Speaker 2: 09:19

哦，真聪明。接下来呢？

Speaker 2: 09:19

Oh, that's smart. What else do we have?

Speaker 1: 09:21

下一个是日本猕猴。

Speaker 1: 09:21

Next is the Japanese macaque.

Speaker 2: 09:23

日本猕猴？“猕猴”是什么？

Speaker 2: 09:23

Japanese macaque? What's a macaque?

Speaker 1: 09:25

猕猴是一种生活在日本的猴子。

Speaker 1: 09:25

A macaque is a type of monkey that lives in Japan.

Speaker 2: 09:27

这种猴子有什么特别的？

Speaker 2: 09:27

What's special about this monkey?

Speaker 1: 09:29

日本猕猴以在温泉里泡澡而闻名。

Speaker 1: 09:29

Japanese macaques are famous for taking baths in hot springs.

Speaker 2: 09:33

在温泉里泡澡？听起来好放松。

Speaker 2: 09:33

Baths in hot springs. That sounds relaxing.

Speaker 1: 09:35

确实如此。然后我们还有一种特别的鱼，叫小丑叶形海龙。

Speaker 1: 09:35

It does. And then we have a very special fish called a harlequin ghost pipefish.

Speaker 2: 09:40

小丑叶形海龙？哇，名字真长。它长什么样？

Speaker 2: 09:40

A harlequin ghost pipefish. Wow. That's a long name. What does it look like?

Speaker 1: 09:45

这种鱼是伪装大师。它身体细长，能改变颜色来匹配周围环境。

Speaker 1: 09:45

This fish is a master of camouflage. It has a long, thin body and it can change its color to match its surroundings.

Speaker 2: 09:53

哇，太酷了！就像海洋里的幽灵。

Speaker 2: 09:53

Wow, that's cool. So that's like a ghost in the ocean.

Speaker 1: 09:56

完全正确。还有种小青蛙，叫春雨蛙。

Speaker 1: 09:56

Exactly. And we have a tiny frog called a spring peeper.

Speaker 2: 09:59

春雨蛙？为什么叫这个名字？

Speaker 2: 09:59

A spring peeper? Why is it called that?

Speaker 1: 10:01

因为它在春天会发出“哔哔”的叫声。

Speaker 1: 10:01

Because it makes a beeping sound that you can hear in the springtime.

Speaker 2: 10:04

哦，所以它是会唱歌的小青蛙。真可爱。

Speaker 2: 10:04

Oh, so it's a singing frog. That's cute.

Speaker 1: 10:06

然后是种鸟，叫红腹啄木鸟。

Speaker 1: 10:06

And then we have a bird called a red bellied woodpecker.

Speaker 2: 10:09

啄木鸟？它做什么的？

Speaker 2: 10:09

A woodpecker? What does it do?

Speaker 1: 10:10

啄木鸟用它们强壮的喙啄树洞。

Speaker 1: 10:10

Woodpeckers use their strong beaks to peck holes in trees.

Speaker 2: 10:15

为什么要啄树洞？

Speaker 2: 10:15

Why do they do that?

Speaker 1: 10:16

为了找虫子吃，也为了筑巢。

Speaker 1: 10:16

They peck holes in trees to find insects, to eat and to make nests.

Speaker 2: 10:20

哦，真聪明。它们把喙当工具用。

Speaker 2: 10:20

Oh, that's smart. They use their beaks like tools.

Speaker 1: 10:22

最后但同样重要的是叉角羚。

Speaker 1: 10:22

And last but not least, we have the pronghorn.

Speaker 2: 10:25

叉角羚？那是什么？

Speaker 2: 10:25

The pronghorn? What's a pronghorn?

Speaker 1: 10:27

叉角羚是一种生活在北美的羚羊。

Speaker 1: 10:27

A pronghorn is a type of antelope that lives in North America.

Speaker 2: 10:31

叉角羚有什么特别的？

Speaker 2: 10:31

What's special about the pronghorn?

Speaker 1: 10:32

叉角羚是世界上跑得最快的陆地动物之一。

Speaker 1: 10:32

The pronghorn is one of the fastest land animals in the world.

Speaker 2: 10:35

哇，我猜它能跑得飞快。

Speaker 2: 10:35

Wow. I bet it can run super fast.

Speaker 1: 10:38

它能跑到每小时60英里。

Speaker 1: 10:38

It can run up to 60 miles per hour.

Speaker 2: 10:40

太神奇了！真希望我也能跑那么快。

Speaker 2: 10:40

That's amazing. I wish I could run that fast.

Speaker 1: 10:43

我也是。好了，今天我们的王牌动物就介绍到这里。

Speaker 1: 10:43

Me too. Well, those are all our wild card animals for today.

Speaker 2: 10:46

哇，今天我们看了这么多神奇的动物，学到了好多东西。

Speaker 2: 10:46

Wow. We saw so many amazing animals today. I learned so much.

Speaker 1: 10:50

我也是。动物王国的多样性真是令人惊叹。

Speaker 1: 10:50

Me too. It's incredible how diverse the animal kingdom is.

Speaker 2: 10:54

是啊，全世界有这么多不同的动物。

Speaker 2: 10:54

Yeah. There are so many different animals all.

Speaker 1: 10:56

世界各地，每种动物都有自己独特的适应能力，帮助它们在各自的环境中生存。

Speaker 1: 10:56

Over the world, and each animal has its own special adaptations that help it survive in its environment.

Speaker 2: 11:01

这正是它们如此酷的原因。不同动物能在这么多不同地方生存，真是太棒了。

Speaker 2: 11:01

That's what makes them so cool. It's so cool how all these different animals can survive in so many different places.

Speaker 1: 11:07

是啊，太神奇了，对吧？比如，那只小小的粉红仙犰狳是怎么保护自己的？

Speaker 1: 11:07

I know. It's amazing, right? Like, how does that tiny little pink fairy armadillo stay safe.

Speaker 2: 11:12

哦，好问题。记得它背上有坚硬的壳吗？

Speaker 2: 11:12

Oh, that's a good question. Well, remember how it has that hard shell on its back?

Speaker 1: 11:17

对，是粉色的，对吧？

Speaker 1: 11:17

Yeah. It's pink, right?

Speaker 2: 11:17

对。那个粉红色的壳其实能帮助它融入阿根廷沙漠的环境。

Speaker 2: 11:17

Yeah. Well, that pink shell actually helps it blend in with the sand in Argentina, where it lives.

Speaker 1: 11:23

所以是伪装？

Speaker 1: 11:23

So it's like camouflage.

Speaker 2: 11:24

没错，就像“大隐隐于市”。而且那个壳非常坚固，能保护犰狳免受捕食者伤害。

Speaker 2: 11:24

Exactly. It's like hiding in plain sight. And that shell is really strong too. It protects the armadillo from predators.

Speaker 1: 11:29

所以它就像一辆粉红色的小坦克？

Speaker 1: 11:29

So it's like a little pink tank?

Speaker 2: 11:31

哈哈，差不多。别忘了它那大爪子，能帮它挖洞居住。

Speaker 2: 11:31

Huh. Yeah, kind of. And don't forget those big claws, they help it dig those burrows where it lives.

Speaker 1: 11:36

哦对，它住在自己挖的地下堡垒里。

Speaker 1: 11:36

Oh yeah, that's right. It's like its own little underground fortress.

Speaker 2: 11:39

我们再聊聊那些猫头鹰。记得我们说它们在夜间捕猎吗？

Speaker 2: 11:39

Now let's talk about those owls again. Remember we said that they hunt at night? Yeah.

Speaker 1: 11:43

它们是夜行动物，对吧？

Speaker 1: 11:43

They're nocturnal, right?

Speaker 2: 11:44

对。它们有惊人的眼睛，能在黑暗中看得非常清楚。

Speaker 2: 11:44

Yep. And they have these amazing eyes that can see really well in the dark.

Speaker 1: 11:49

所以即使在漆黑的夜里，它们也能看到猎物？

Speaker 1: 11:49

So they can see their prey even when it's super dark out?

Speaker 2: 11:52

没错。即使光线极弱，它们也能从远处发现一只小老鼠。

Speaker 2: 11:52

Exactly. They can spot a tiny little mouse from far away even if there's barely any light.

Speaker 1: 11:57

哇，这简直是超能力。

Speaker 1: 11:57

Wow, that's like a superpower.

Speaker 2: 12:00

确实很神奇。而且它们的羽毛也很特别。

Speaker 2: 12:00

It is pretty amazing. And their feathers are special too.

Speaker 1: 12:03

羽毛有什么特别的？

Speaker 1: 12:03

What's special about their feathers?

Speaker 2: 12:05

它们的羽毛超级安静。猫头鹰飞行时几乎不发出任何声音。

Speaker 2: 12:05

They're super quiet. Quiet? When owls fly, they don't make any noise.

Speaker 1: 12:09

哦，太棒了！所以它们能悄无声息地接近猎物？

Speaker 1: 12:09

Oh, wow. So they can sneak up on their prey without being heard?

Speaker 2: 12:12

对，它们就像夜间的无声忍者。

Speaker 2: 12:12

That's right. They're like silent ninjas of the night.

Speaker 1: 12:17

好，我们再聊聊那些可爱的红毛猩猩宝宝。

Speaker 1: 12:17

Okay, now let's talk about those cute baby orangutans again.

Speaker 2: 12:20

哦对，那些生活在雨林里的。

Speaker 2: 12:20

Oh yeah, the ones that live in the rainforest.

Speaker 1: 12:22

对。记得它们什么都跟妈妈学吗？

Speaker 1: 12:22

Yep. Remember how they learn everything from their mommies? Yeah.

Speaker 2: 12:25

就像上丛林学校。

Speaker 2: 12:25

It's like they go to jungle school.

Speaker 1: 12:27

确实是。而且它们会和妈妈待很长时间。

Speaker 1: 12:27

It is. And they stay with their moms for a long time.

Speaker 2: 12:30

为什么它们要跟妈妈待那么久？

Speaker 2: 12:30

Why do they stay with their moms for so long?

Speaker 1: 12:32

因为它们要学的东西太多了，比如爬树、找食物、搭窝。

Speaker 1: 12:32

Because they have so much to learn. Like how to climb trees, how to find food, how to build nests.

Speaker 2: 12:37

哦对，那些高高挂在树上的窝，真酷。

Speaker 2: 12:37

Oh yeah, those nests high up in the trees. They're pretty cool.

Speaker 1: 12:41

确实。小猩猩要花很长时间才能学会所有这些技能。

Speaker 1: 12:41

They are. And it takes a long time for the baby orangutans to learn how to do all those things.

Speaker 2: 12:46

所以它们需要妈妈教。

Speaker 2: 12:46

That's why they need their mommies to teach them.

Speaker 1: 12:48

没错。你知道吗，鬣狗也很像。

Speaker 1: 12:48

Exactly. You know, hyenas are a lot like that too.

Speaker 2: 12:51

鬣狗？你说的是群居的那种？

Speaker 2: 12:51

Hyenas? You mean the ones that live in clans?

Speaker 1: 12:53

对。它们生活在大家族里，靠团队合作生存。

Speaker 1: 12:53

Yep. They live in big family groups and they work together to survive.

Speaker 2: 12:57

对，鬣狗靠团队合作。

Speaker 2: 12:57

Oh yeah, that's right. It's all about teamwork with hyenas.

Speaker 1: 13:01

还记得我们说过雌性鬣狗是族群的领导者吗？

Speaker 1: 13:01

And remember how we said that female hyenas are the leaders of their clans?

Speaker 2: 13:05

对，女孩力量！

Speaker 2: 13:05

Yeah, girl power.

Speaker 1: 13:07

雌性比雄性更大更强壮，领导狩猎并保护领地。

Speaker 1: 13:07

The females are bigger and stronger than the males and they lead the hunts and protect the territory.

Speaker 2: 13:12

有点像我们说的猫头鹰。它们都是夜间猎手。

Speaker 2: 13:12

It's kind of like those owls we talked about. They're both nighttime hunters.

Speaker 1: 13:17

确实。但猫头鹰是独行猎手，意思是它们独自捕猎。

Speaker 1: 13:17

That's true. But owls are solitary hunters, which means they hunt alone.

Speaker 2: 13:22

而鬣狗是群体猎手，一起合作捕猎。

Speaker 2: 13:22

And hyenas are pack hunters. Which means they hunt together.

Speaker 1: 13:25

对。不同动物有不同的生存策略。

Speaker 1: 13:25

That's right. Different animals have different strategies for survival.

Speaker 2: 13:28

大自然的运作方式真酷。

Speaker 2: 13:28

It's so cool how nature works.

Speaker 1: 13:30

说到酷，还记得我们聊过的冠龙恐龙吗？

Speaker 1: 13:30

Speaking of cool, remember that Corythosaurus dinosaur we talked about?

Speaker 2: 13:34

对，就是头上长着大冠的那个。

Speaker 2: 13:34

Yeah, the one with the big crest on its head.

Speaker 1: 13:36

对。还记得科学家认为那个冠是做什么用的吗？

Speaker 1: 13:36

Yep. Do you remember what scientists think that crest was for?

Speaker 2: 13:41

我记得你说过，可能是用来发声的。

Speaker 2: 13:41

I think he said it might have been for making sounds.

Speaker 1: 13:44  
没错。科学家认为冠龙可能用它的冠发出响亮的叫声。

Speaker 1: 13:44  
That's right. They think Corythosaurus might have used its crest to make loud calls.

Speaker 2: 13:49  
比如和其他冠龙交流，或者吸引配偶。

Speaker 2: 13:49  
Like to talk to other Corythosaurus. Or to attract mates.

Speaker 1: 13:53  
完全正确。就像一个内置的喇叭。

Speaker 1: 13:53  
Exactly. It's like a built-in trumpet.

Speaker 2: 13:55  
太酷了！真希望我头上也有个冠。

Speaker 2: 13:55  
That's so cool. I wish I had a crest on my head.

Speaker 1: 13:58  
嗯……也许还是算了。说到那些王牌动物——

Speaker 1: 13:58  
Huh. Maybe not. Speaking of those wild card animals.

Speaker 2: 14:01  
哦对！那些动物太棒了。

Speaker 2: 14:01  
Oh yeah. Those were awesome.

Speaker 1: 14:03  
我知道你最喜欢哪一个。

Speaker 1: 14:03  
I know which one was your favorite.

Speaker 2: 14:06  
这可难选了。我觉得我最喜欢小丑叶形海龙。

Speaker 2: 14:06  
That's a tough one. I think I liked the harlequin ghost pipefish the best.

Speaker 1: 14:10  
哦对，就是那个能变色融入周围环境的。

Speaker 1: 14:10  
Oh yeah. The one that can change its color to match its surroundings.

Speaker 2: 14:13  
对，那太酷了，就像直接消失在珊瑚里一样。

Speaker 2: 14:13  
Yep. That was so cool. It's like it disappears right into the coral.

Speaker 1: 14:17  
我知道，就像魔法一样。

Speaker 1: 14:17  
I know. It's like magic.

Speaker 2: 14:19  
我也喜欢春雨蛙，就是叫声像雪橇铃铛的那个。

Speaker 2: 14:19  
And I like the spring peeper frog too. The one that sounds like sleigh bells.

Speaker 1: 14:22  
嗯，我也是。

Speaker 1: 14:22  
Huh. Me too.

Speaker 2: 14:23  
对。

Speaker 2: 14:23  
Yeah.

Speaker 1: 14:24  
这么小的青蛙能发出这么响亮的声音，真是不可思议。

Speaker 1: 14:24  
It's amazing how such a tiny frog can make such a loud sound.

Speaker 2: 14:27  
是啊，对吧？大自然充满了惊喜。

Speaker 2: 14:27  
I know, right? Nature's full of surprises.

Speaker 1: 14:29  
确实如此。

Speaker 1: 14:29  
It really is.

Speaker 2: 14:30  
真的。就好像世界上所有的动物都彼此契合。

Speaker 2: 14:30  
It really is. It's like all the animals in the world fit together.

Speaker 1: 14:33  
对，就像一幅巨大的拼图。今天我们认识了这么多拼图碎片。

Speaker 1: 14:33  
Yeah. Like a big puzzle. And we got to learn about so many of those puzzle pieces today.

Speaker 2: 14:37  
我知道。我还学到了一些新单词呢。

Speaker 2: 14:37  
I know. And I learned some new words too.

Speaker 1: 14:39  
我也是。学新单词真有趣。

Speaker 1: 14:39  
Me too. It's so much fun to learn new words.

Speaker 2: 14:42  
对啊。你还记得我们把动物和它们的身体部位配对的游戏吗？

Speaker 2: 14:42  
Yeah. Do you remember when we matched those animals to their body parts?

Speaker 1: 14:46  
哦对！比如海象和它的胡子。你能再拼一遍“胡子”吗？

Speaker 1: 14:46  
Oh yeah. Like the walrus with its mustache. Can you spell mustache again?

Speaker 2: 14:50  
M-U-S-T-A-C-H-E，“胡子”。

Speaker 2: 14:50  
M U S T A C H E — mustache.

Speaker 1: 14:54  
还有豪猪和它的刺。Q-U-I-L-L-S。还有——

Speaker 1: 14:54  
And the porcupine with its quills. Q U I L L S. And—

Speaker 2: 15:00  
企鹅和它的羽毛。F-E-A-T-H-E-R。

Speaker 2: 15:00  
The penguin with its feathers. F E A T H E R.

Speaker 1: 15:03  
S。我们看了好多酷动物。你最喜欢哪个王牌动物？

Speaker 1: 15:03  
S. We saw so many cool animals. Which wild card animal did you like the best?

Speaker 2: 15:10  
好难选啊，每一个都那么棒。

Speaker 2: 15:10  
That's a hard one. There were so many good ones.

Speaker 1: 15:12  
我知道，对吧？

Speaker 1: 15:12  
I know, right?

Speaker 2: 15:13  
好吧好吧……我觉得我最喜欢北极狼。

Speaker 2: 15:13  
Okay, okay. I... I think my favorite was the Arctic wolf.

Speaker 1: 15:16  
哦对，就是生活在极寒之地的那个。

Speaker 1: 15:16  
Oh yeah. The one that lives in the really cold place.

Speaker 2: 15:18  
对，它还有厚厚的白毛来保暖。

Speaker 2: 15:18  
Yep. And it has that thick white fur to stay warm.

Speaker 1: 15:21  
就像一个毛茸茸的大雪球。

Speaker 1: 15:21  
It's like a big fluffy snowball.

Speaker 2: 15:23  
你呢？你最喜欢哪个？

Speaker 2: 15:23  
What about you? What was your favorite?

Speaker 1: 15:26  
我觉得我最喜欢日本猕猴。

Speaker 1: 15:26  
I think I like the Japanese macaques the best.

Speaker 2: 15:28  
哦对，就是那些在温泉里泡澡的猴子。

Speaker 2: 15:28  
Oh yeah. The monkeys that take baths in the hot springs.

Speaker 1: 15:31  
对，听起来就特别放松。

Speaker 1: 15:31  
Yep. It just sounds so relaxing.

Speaker 2: 15:33  
是啊！真希望我也能泡温泉。

Speaker 2: 15:33  
I know, right? I wish I could take a bath in a hot spring.

Speaker 1: 15:36  
也许有一天我们可以。

Speaker 1: 15:36  
Maybe someday we can.

Speaker 2: 15:37  
那太棒了！

Speaker 2: 15:37  
That would be awesome.
